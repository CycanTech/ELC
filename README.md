# ELC — Everlasting Cash
# 1. Introduction

ELC is a decentralized anti-inflation stablecoin with a reserve system, a hybrid of a crypto-collateralized and algorithmic stablecoin mechanism, with the collateralized mechanism providing the underlying value guarantee, and the algorithmic mechanism incentivizing the participants of the collateralized mechanism on one hand and hedging the downside risk when the demand for the stablecoin is insufficient on the other. 

The Cycan Network (CYA) is an isomorphic parachain on the Polkadot network. The Everlasting Parachain (ELP), as Cycan’s canary network, is the isomorphic parachain on the Kusama network, which is Polkadot’s canary network. The Cycan Network aims to build a decentralized autonomous trust (DAT) protocol for everyone.The ELC protocol is a smart contract protocol based on the Cycan Network/Everlasting Parachain.

# 2. Overview

Based on the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem,

1.Adopting a crypto-collateralized mechanism to ensure the basic value of ELC.

2.Using a reserve-based liquidity mining mechanism to issue additional ELC, ELC grows in an orderly manner with the expansion of demand.

3.Adopting the anti-inflation model and using the anti-inflation factor k to adjust the goal of ELC price control. The annual appreciation rate of ELC is roughly the same as the inflation rate of USD.

4.The buffer mechanism with reserves for price falls avoids the death loop trap of algorithmic stablecoins.
